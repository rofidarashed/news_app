## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Architecture

This project leverages a modern stack to deliver a high-quality mobile application.

*   **Framework:** Flutter
*   **Language:** Dart
*   **Architecture:** The app follows a simple, feature-first widget structure. The UI is decoupled into logical components (`pages` and `widgets`) for better organization and reusability.
*   **API Integration:** Fetches data from a public news API (e.g., NewsAPI.org) using an HTTP client to handle network requests.
*   **State Management:** Utilizes `StatefulWidget` and `setState` for managing local widget state, keeping the architecture simple and easy to understand for this scale.
*   **Core Flutter Widgets:**
    *   `CustomScrollView`, `SliverAppBar`, and `SliverList` for creating high-performance, custom scrolling effects.
    *   `FutureBuilder` for asynchronously fetching and displaying news data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   You must have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. For installation instructions, see the official Flutter documentation.

3.  **Configure your API Key:**
    *This project requires an API key to fetch news data. You will need to create a file or class to store your key and ensure it is not checked into version control.*

    ```
    Then, add `lib/api_key.dart` to your `.gitignore` file.
