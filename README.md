*   **Categorized News:** Effortlessly browse articles from a wide range of categories like Business, Technology, Sports, Health, and more.
*   **Dynamic Content:** The news feed is always up-to-date, fetching the latest articles from a live news API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

This project leverages a modern stack to deliver a high-quality mobile application.

*   **Framework:** Flutter
*   **Language:** Dart
*   **Architecture:** The app follows a simple, feature-first widget structure. The UI is decoupled into logical components (`pages` and `widgets`) for better organization and reusability.
*   **API Integration:** Fetches data from a public news API (e.g., NewsAPI.org) using an HTTP client to handle network requests.
*   **State Management:** Utilizes `StatefulWidget` and `setState` for managing local widget state, keeping the architecture simple and easy to understand for this scale.
*   **Core Flutter Widgets:**
    *   `CustomScrollView`, `SliverAppBar`, and `SliverList` for creating high-performance, custom scrolling effects.
    *   `FutureBuilder` for asynchronously fetching and displaying news data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   You must have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. For installation instructions, see the official Flutter documentation.
*   An API Key from a news provider like NewsAPI.org.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flashnews_app.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh

3.  **Configure your API Key:**
    *This project requires an API key to fetch news data. You will need to create a file or class to store your key and ensure it is not checked into version control.*

    For example, you could create a file `lib/api_key.dart`:
    ```dart
    // lib/api_key.dart
    const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
    ```
    Then, add `lib/api_key.dart` to your `.gitignore` file.

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

5.  **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    flutter run
